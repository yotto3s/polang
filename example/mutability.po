; Mutability demonstration
; Variables are immutable by default, use 'let x = mut value' for mutable variables
; Mutable variables require explicit dereference with *x to access values

; Immutable variable (default)
let x = 10

; Mutable variable - has type 'mut i64' (mutable reference)
let counter = mut 0

; Reassign mutable variable using <- operator
; Assignment is an expression that returns the assigned value
; Use *counter to read the current value
counter <- *counter + 1
counter <- *counter + 1
counter <- *counter + 1

; Chained assignment: both a and b get the value 5
let a = mut 0
let b = mut 0
a <- (b <- 5)

; Final result: x + *counter + *a + *b = 10 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 23
x + *counter + *a + *b
