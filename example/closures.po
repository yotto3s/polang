; Closures - functions that capture variables from enclosing scope

; Simple closure
let base = 10
let add_base(x: int): int = x + base
let result1 = add_base(5)    ; 15

; Multiple captures
let a = 1
let b = 2
let c = 3
let sum_all(): int = a + b + c
let result2 = sum_all()       ; 6

; Final result
result1 + result2   ; 15 + 6 = 21
