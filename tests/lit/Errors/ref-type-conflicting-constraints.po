; Test: conflicting type constraints for same variable
; First use (y) resolves x to i32, second use (z) conflicts with i64
; CHECK: Type error: Variable 'z' declared as ref i64 but initialized with ref i32 (no implicit conversion) at line 1, column 1
let x = 10
let y: ref i32 = ref x
let z: ref i64 = ref x
